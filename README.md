These are a set of .stl files for commonly used items in the Clastic Stratigraphy Research Group at the University of Arkansas

These files include:

1. a holder for 1-inch polished mounts
    - top and bottom are seperate files
2. CSRG branded scale bars
3. boxes for thin sections - not our original files
4. a holder for little cases that hold sticky mounts for zircon.

More to come!

Happy printing.
